# User Experience #

## User Stories ##
- As a user I would like an easy interface with clear instruction.
- As a user I would like the quiz to be difficult but fun.
- As a user I would like to be able to see the leaderboard. 
- As a user I would like to know my score and see how many points I can get.



## Wireframes ##
The initial wireframes were made on [Balsamiq](https://www.balsamiq.cloud). These wireframes of the quiz, show a somewhat less thought out design but shows how much I've built upon to make sure the UX is stronger.

I wanted to make this a really easy interface with little distraction to ensure the user has the best experience. 

## Flow Charts ##
I made the flow chart using [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com). This again shows a little more thought out process including different difficulties which would be offered in a future build. It also details how only 10 questions would be shown, I decided in terms of a competitive user experience, its better to have one mode and compete for that top spot.

## Design Choices ##

### Typograghy ###
Although technically not typography, the font art I used within my project was imported using [art](https://pypi.org/project/art/). I wanted the main screen to stand out and this can be seen by all headings within the quiz game.

### Colour Choices ###
The colours I've chosen were inspired by the french flag. Mainly because when thinking of a standout group of colours for musical theatre, the french flag is such a prominant option due to the musical Les Miserables and it helps the screen pop out too. So I used the Linear gradient on [Gradient CSS](http://www.gradientcss.com/) to help me achieve this.

I also replicated this in the font colour choices for the most part of the quiz.
